🌐 Jose’s Progress Tracker

A personal site designed to showcase my skills, projects, YouTube content, and consistency in different areas of life. Think of it as a GitHub for me, where instead of just code commits, I log and visualize progress in:

🎹 Music (piano, guitar, etc.)

💻 Programming & AI/ML learning

🌏 Languages (Japanese, Korean, French)

🏋️ Fitness (workouts, nutrition consistency)

🎥 Content creation (YouTube, vlogs, etc.)

🚀 Career development (internship applications, certifications, personal projects)

✨ Features

Profile Dashboard: Central hub with bio, highlights, and goals.

Consistency Tracker: Graphs/charts (like GitHub’s contributions grid) to track habits and progress.

Projects Log: Record milestones (apps, code, piano pieces learned, languages studied).

Content Feed: Pull in YouTube videos, blog posts, or notes automatically.

Goals & Achievements: Show current goals (ex: JLPT N2, internship apps, PR in deadlift) and mark completed ones.

Public Portfolio: Something you can share with recruiters, collaborators, or friends.

🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)

Frontend: React + Tailwind (clean, modern UI)

Backend: Node.js/Express or Django/FastAPI (for logging & APIs)

Database: MongoDB/Postgres (to store progress logs, goals, habits)

APIs: YouTube API for pulling content, maybe Notion/Trello API for goals integration

Deployment: Vercel / Netlify (frontend) + Railway / Heroku (backend)

📈 Vision

This site is more than a portfolio — it’s a progress journal.
I want to show not just my finished projects but also the process: how consistently I’ve been practicing, learning, and building.

Future ideas:

Social version (others can fork & use it for their own lives)

Leaderboards with friends

Public “commit history” for habits
