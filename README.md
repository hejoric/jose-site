# Hejoric-dotcom

🌐 **Hejoric-dotcom** is my personal site and living portfolio — a “GitHub for life.”  
It tracks my progress across skills, projects, content creation, and habits, while showcasing my work and growth over time.

## 💡 Vision

This site is more than a portfolio — it’s a progress journal.  
I want to show not just my finished projects but also **how consistently I’ve been practicing, learning, and building**.  
Think of it as a central hub where personal development, creative content, and career growth intersect.
